# Employee-Managing-Scheduling-System
Employee Scheduler with Predictive Scheduling and Dynamic Availability This project implements a Django-based employee scheduler with features for predicting customer traffic and dynamically adjusting schedules based on real-time employee availability.

**Functionality Overview:**

* **Employee Management:** Manage employee data, including skills and availability. (Existing functionality)
* **Shift Management:** Create, view, and manage employee shifts. (Existing functionality)
* **Predictive Scheduling:**
    * Integrates with a machine learning model to predict customer traffic. (Requires further development)
    * Uses predicted traffic to estimate staffing needs.
* **Dynamic Availability:**
    * Enables employees to update their availability in real-time. (Requires further development)
    * Schedules employees based on both skills and current availability.

**Installation:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
    * pip (usually comes with Python)
    * Git ([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) (for version control)
2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/employee-scheduler.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd employee_scheduler
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Building and Running:**

1. **Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate.bat  # macOS
   ```

2. **Run Django migrations (to create database tables):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ by default.

**Current Development Status:**

* The core functionalities of employee and shift management are implemented.
* The prediction and dynamic availability features are partially implemented and require further development.  

**Design Choices and Technical Challenges:**

* **Machine Learning Model Selection:** Choosing the most suitable model for customer traffic prediction depends on the available data and desired accuracy. Explore options like Random Forest or LSTMs.
* **Real-time Employee Availability:** Implementing a mechanism for employees to update their availability in real-time requires additional development (e.g., a web interface or API). Security considerations should be addressed when integrating with external systems.
* **Scheduling Algorithm:** The current scheduling logic is a placeholder. You can implement a more sophisticated algorithm that considers factors like skills, experience, workload preferences, and fairness in assigning shifts.
